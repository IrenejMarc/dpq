# dpq - A D PostgreSQL library
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IrenejMarc/dpq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IrenejMarc/dpq)

dpq wraps the libpq library and aims to provide a simple and modern way to access PostgreSQL in the D programming language.

## Feature highlights:
 - Manual querying using `Query` or `Connection`'s `exec` and `execParams`
 - Automatic schema generation from D structures (including PKs, indexes, ... check example below)
 - ORM functions `findOne`, `findBy`, `insert`, `update`, `count`, ... on `Connection`
 - Full support for `Nullable` and `Typedef` types.
 - `foreach` looping through `Result` and `Row`
 - Data is sent *fully* in binary, including structures and arrays (and arrays of structures)
 - Ability to specify a custom serialiser for any custom type
 - Pre-existing serialisers cover most needs, and `SysTime`
 - (Basic) async query support (will be improved in the future)
 - (Basic) prepared statement support (will be improved in the future)


## Documentation
Documentation is in the code itself, though pretty lacking currently.

Unit tests might provide some useful usage examples too.

## Test
Before running  tests configure the database (only once):
```
$ psql -U postgres < prepare_test_db.sql
```

## Some notes:
 - If a wrong type is specified to `Value`'s `as`, the results are undefined, but most likely a `RangeError` or garbage.
 - Using QueryBuilder, when specifying columns, make sure they are not reserverd SQL keywords, they will not be escaped automatically (wrap keywords in `" "`)
 - Be careful with using `Connection`'s `exec` function, since it only returns textual values, that are not currently supported by dpq's `Value`. (execParams can be used even without params and will return binary data)
